                                                    Organising interesting workshops that cause curiosity for students majoring in IT and those
                                                    who want to learn about information technology in particular. Although I have not worked much
                                                    with DSC yet, I hope it will always keep the enthusiasm and rapidly developing. <small class="fa fa-quote-left"></small></p>

                                                    developed by Google. Therefore, students have opportunities to access useful knowledge, especially new technology from
                                                    Google. I hope that DSC will be flourish and bring achievements and glory to our school.<small class="fa fa-quote-left"></small></p>
